# HEAT Fullstack (Rails) Assessment

In this assessment you are provided a landing page that is connected to a sample Rails API, both with various issues (detailed below). Your task is to solve the issues to the best of your ability. You can take as much time as you need, but we recommend completing this assessment in one go.

You can look up documentation to help you with this assessment, however please refrain from pasting code as this will result in immediate disqualification. 

## Recommended tools

This project uses HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and SCSS for the frontend. It uses Ruby (3.1.2) and Rails (7.0.4) for the API. We recommend creating a fork of this repo and cloning your fork locally. 

Once you have a local version we recommend using VScode with the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass) extensions.

> **NOTE:** You need to open the frontend folder and the API folder in separate VScode windows, otherwise the links will be wrong and the live reload will cause issues.

To start the frontend, open the `style.scss` file and run the live sass compiler from the bottom right toolbar, then open the `index.html` file and run the live server "Go live" from the bottom right toolbar. This will enable live compilation and hot reloading for your development environment.

To start the API, make sure you have the correct versions of Ruby and Rails installed. Then run `bundle install` to install the required gems, migrate and seed the database, and then start the server with `rails s`. The API is located in a namespaced path at `/api/v1`.

Part of our assessment criteria is how you utilize git, so make sure you are making regular sensible commits. Push your finished work to your forked repo when you are done, and send us the link. Make sure the repo is public so we are able to make our assessment.

## What are we looking for?

Amongst other things, we are mainly are assessing your ability to solve typical production issues on the fly using technologies or methods you may not have seen before. We are also interested in your ability to write clear and maintainable code, and we are also assessing your use of git e.g. how you name commit messages and when you choose to make a commit. 

## Issues to solve

1. [API] Initially the API only returns an empty array. Make this return an array of pet objects instead.

2. [FRONTEND] The company have recently changed their brand colour from #7AC3B0 to #7AACC3. Change all instances of the colour to a variable and create a variable for the brand colour so we can change it easier in future.

3. [API] The company currently doesn't sort the pet records in any specific order. Change this to display pet records in order of their name alphabetically, and push featured pets to the front. Do this in the API, not the frontend.

4. [FRONTEND] The links in the header change to grey when moused over. Add a transition over 300ms to this effect, and also add a transition to lower the opacity of the link over the same duration to 0.65 when moused over.

5. [API] In the frontend nav there is an option to view only dogs or only cats. Add optional filters to the API to allow this.

6. [FRONTEND] Some of the records have a 'featured' property that is true. Make any cards for a featured record have a gold border.

7. [MIXED] Add a new record of a family pet or a pet from TV to the database seeds. Give this pet a special property and make it's card stand out visually amongst the rest.

## Bonus issues

If you are applying for a non-junior job, or found the above issues easy to solve, you can pick a couple of the bonus issues to tackle. These are more advanced, and will allow us to learn more about you.

1. [API] Implement pagination for the API, allowing the frontend to display a set number of pet records per page.

2. [MIXED] Add the ability to search for pets by name, breed, or species.

3. [API] Add the ability to create, update, and delete pet records through the API. Implement proper authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can perform these actions.

4. [FRONTEND] Implement a modal window that pops up when a more info button is clicked, displaying more detailed information about the pet, including an image and a description.

5. [API] Add the ability to sort the pet records by multiple criteria, such as species, breed, and age.

6. [FRONTEND] The page has has a responsive design for mobile and desktop. Implement a middle state for tablets. 

7. [MIXED] Implement an error handling mechanism for both the frontend and the API, displaying appropriate error messages to the user in case of any errors or failures.
